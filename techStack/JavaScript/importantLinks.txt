1. Strings are immutable and arrays are mutable
2. console.log and console.dir
`console.log` and `console.dir` are both methods available in the JavaScript console for logging information during development. However, they serve slightly different purposes:

1. **`console.log`:**
   - `console.log` is primarily used for printing messages to the console. It is a general-purpose logging method that accepts any number of arguments and prints them to the console.

   ```javascript
   console.log('This is a log message.');
   ```

   - When used with an object or array, `console.log` displays a collapsed view, allowing you to interactively explore the object or array by clicking on the arrow to expand it.

2. **`console.dir`:**
   - `console.dir` is specifically designed for logging a detailed representation of JavaScript objects. It is used to display the properties of an object in a structured way.

   ```javascript
   const myObject = { name: 'John', age: 30 };
   console.dir(myObject);
   ```

   - `console.dir` is useful when you want to see the detailed structure of an object, especially when it has nested properties.

In summary, while both methods can be used to log information to the console, `console.log` is more general-purpose and is often used for simple logging, including strings and variables. On the other hand, `console.dir` is specifically intended for inspecting the detailed structure of JavaScript objects. The choice between them depends on your specific debugging or logging needs.
