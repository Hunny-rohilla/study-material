// useContaxt hook
// ----------------
// In React, the Context API provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props manually at every level. The `useContext` hook is a React hook that allows you to subscribe to React context without introducing nesting.

import React, { createContext, useCallback, useContext } from "react";

// Step 1: Create a context
const MyContext = createContext();

// Step 2: Create a provider component
const MyProvider = ({ children }) => {
  // You can define the state or any other data you want to share here
  const sharedData = {
    username: "JohnDoe",
    theme: "light",
  };

  return <MyContext.Provider value={sharedData}>{children}</MyContext.Provider>;
};

// Step 3: Use the provider in your app
const Aapp = () => {
  return (
    <MyProvider>
      <ChildComponent />
    </MyProvider>
  );
};

// Step 4: Use the useContext hook in a child component
const ChildComponent = () => {
  const contextData = useContext(MyContext);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Username: {contextData.username}</p>
      <p>Theme: {contextData.theme}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

// export default Aapp;

// ----------------------------------------------------------------

// Difference between React's Context API and Redux.

// React's Context API and Redux are both state management solutions for React applications, but they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics. Here are the key differences between `useContext` (part of the Context API) and Redux:

// 1. **Scope and Use Case:**
//    - **Context API (`useContext`):** Designed by React, the Context API is primarily used for passing data through the component tree without prop drilling. It's suitable for managing global state within a React application, but it might be less efficient for large-scale applications due to its re-rendering behavior.
//    - **Redux:** Redux is a state management library that provides a global store to manage the entire state of an application. It's especially useful for complex state management, asynchronous actions, and applications with a large number of components that need access to shared state.

// 2. **Flexibility:**
//    - **Context API (`useContext`):** It is simpler and more lightweight compared to Redux. It's suitable for simpler state management scenarios and when you don't want the overhead of a full-scale state management library.
//    - **Redux:** Offers a more structured and scalable solution, providing a predictable state container. It enforces a strict unidirectional data flow and has middleware support for handling side effects.

// 3. **Reducers and Actions:**
//    - **Context API (`useContext`):** While it provides a way to share state, it doesn't have built-in support for reducers or actions. Developers might need to implement their own patterns for managing complex state updates.
//    - **Redux:** It encourages the use of reducers and actions to manage state updates in a predictable way. Actions are dispatched to trigger state changes, and reducers handle these actions to update the state in a controlled manner.

// 4. **DevTools:**
//    - **Context API (`useContext`):** React DevTools can be used to inspect the state changes within the context, but it may not offer the extensive features provided by Redux DevTools.
//    - **Redux:** Comes with a powerful set of DevTools that allow developers to inspect and time-travel through state changes, making it easier to debug and understand the application's state evolution.

// 5. **Middleware:**
//    - **Context API (`useContext`):** It doesn't have built-in middleware support for handling side effects like asynchronous operations.
//    - **Redux:** Provides middleware support, and popular middleware like Redux Thunk or Redux Saga can be used to manage asynchronous actions, side effects, and more complex logic.

// In summary, the choice between `useContext` and Redux depends on the complexity of your application and the specific requirements for state management. For simpler scenarios, the Context API may be sufficient, while Redux is often preferred for larger applications with more complex state management needs.

// -----------------------------------------------------------------

// useMemo Hook
// ============
// The `useMemo` hook in React is used to memoize the result of a computation, preventing unnecessary recalculations on every render. It takes a function and an array of dependencies, and it will only recompute the memoized value when one of the dependencies has changed. This can be especially useful for optimizing performance in scenarios where expensive calculations are involved.

import React, { useState, useMemo } from "react";

const ExpensiveCalculationComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [data, setData] = useState([]);

  // Example of an expensive calculation
  const expensiveResult = useMemo(() => {
    console.log("Recalculating expensiveResult...");
    // Perform some complex computation based on count and data
    return count * data.length;
  }, [count, data]); // Dependency array

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment Count</button>

      <p>Data Length: {data.length}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setData([...data, Math.random()])}>
        Add Data
      </button>

      <p>Expensive Result: {expensiveResult}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

// export default ExpensiveCalculationComponent;

// In this example:
// 1. We have a component that includes a count state and a data state.
// 2. We use the `useMemo` hook to memoize the result of an expensive calculation based on the count and the length of the data array.
// 3. The `useMemo` hook takes two arguments: a function representing the expensive calculation and an array of dependencies. The memoized value is recalculated only if one of the dependencies in the array has changed.
// 4. The `expensiveResult` value is then displayed in the component.

// Using `useMemo` in scenarios where expensive calculations are involved can help improve the performance of your React components by avoiding unnecessary recalculations on each render.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------

// useCallback Hook
// ================

// The `useCallback` hook in React is used to memoize a callback function, preventing it from being recreated on every render. This can be beneficial when passing callbacks to child components, as it ensures that the callback remains the same reference across renders, optimizing performance.

import React, { useState, useCallback } from "react";

const CallbackExample = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // Example of a callback function
  const handleClick = () => {
    console.log("Button clicked!");
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  // Memoizing the callback using useCallback
  const memoizedHandleClick = useCallback(handleClick, [count]);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      {/* Using the memoized callback in a child component */}
      <ChildComponent handleClick={memoizedHandleClick} />
    </div>
  );
};

// const ChildComponent = ({ handleClick }) => {
//   return (
//     <div>
//       <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>
//     </div>
//   );
// };

// export default CallbackExample;

// ---------

import React, { useState, useCallback } from "react";

const DynamicCallbackExample = () => {
  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState("");

  // Example of a callback function that depends on user input
  const handleInputChange = (event) => {
    setInputValue(event.target.value);
  };

  // Memoizing the callback using useCallback
  const memoizedHandleInputChange = useCallback(handleInputChange, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <label>
        Type something:
        <input
          type="text"
          value={inputValue}
          onChange={memoizedHandleInputChange}
        />
      </label>
      <DisplayInputValue inputValue={inputValue} />
    </div>
  );
};

const DisplayInputValue = ({ inputValue }) => {
  return <p>Current Input Value: {inputValue}</p>;
};

export default DynamicCallbackExample;

// In this example:
// 1. We have a parent component (`CallbackExample`) with a state variable `count`.
// 2. There's a callback function named `handleClick` that is triggered when a button is clicked. It also updates the `count` state.
// 3. We use the `useCallback` hook to memoize the `handleClick` callback, passing the callback function and an array of dependencies (`[count]`). The dependencies array ensures that the callback is recreated only when the dependencies change.
// 4. The memoized callback (`memoizedHandleClick`) is then passed down to a child component (`ChildComponent`).

// By using `useCallback`, the `handleClick` callback remains the same reference as long as the `count` state doesn't change. This can be useful to prevent unnecessary re-renders of child components that rely on this callback, optimizing the performance of your React application.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// useRef Hook
// ============

// The `useRef` hook in React is used to create mutable object references that persist across renders. It is often used to access and interact with the DOM directly or to persist values across renders without causing re-renders. Here's an example demonstrating the use of the `useRef` hook:

import React, { useRef, useState, useEffect } from "react";

const RefExample = () => {
  // Creating a useRef for accessing the input element
  const inputRef = useRef(null);

  // State for managing a value
  const [value, setValue] = useState("");

  useEffect(() => {
    // Focus on the input element when the component mounts
    inputRef.current.focus();
  }, []);

  const handleInputChange = (event) => {
    // Updating the value state
    setValue(event.target.value);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <label>
        Type something:
        {/* Attaching the inputRef to the input element */}
        <input
          type="text"
          value={value}
          onChange={handleInputChange}
          ref={inputRef}
        />
      </label>
      <p>You typed: {value}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

// export default RefExample;

// In this example:
// 1. We create a functional component called `RefExample`.
// 2. Inside the component, a `useRef` hook is used to create a mutable reference named `inputRef` and initialized with `null`.
// 3. The `inputRef` is then attached to the input element using the `ref` attribute. This allows us to access and manipulate the input element directly.
// 4. The `useEffect` hook is used to focus on the input element when the component mounts. This is possible because `inputRef.current` now references the actual DOM element.
// 5. The component also includes an input field, and the value of the input is stored in the component's state using `useState`.
// 6. The `handleInputChange` function updates the `value` state as the user types.

// Using `useRef` in this example allows us to interact with the DOM element (input) without causing re-renders. It's particularly useful for scenarios where you need to imperatively modify or access DOM elements or when you want to persist values across renders without triggering a re-render.

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Explain what is higher order component in react. why we use this ? when we use this? and how we use this? with example.
// ====================================

// In React, a Higher-Order Component (HOC) is a function that takes a component and returns a new component with additional props or behavior. It's a pattern used for code reuse, abstraction, and enhancing components in a modular way. HOCs allow you to wrap one or more components with shared functionality, making it a powerful tool for cross-cutting concerns like logging, authentication, or state management.

// ### Why Use Higher-Order Components?

// 1. **Reusability:** HOCs promote code reuse by encapsulating common functionality. Instead of duplicating code across multiple components, you can wrap them with an HOC.

// 2. **Abstraction:** They help abstract away complex logic or behavior from the presentation components, making the codebase more maintainable and readable.

// 3. **Separation of Concerns:** HOCs allow you to separate concerns like data fetching, state management, or authentication from the components, making each piece more focused and modular.

// ### When to Use Higher-Order Components?

// Use HOCs when you find yourself duplicating logic across components, and you want to abstract that logic into a reusable piece. Common use cases include:

// - **Authorization and Authentication:** Controlling access to certain components based on the user's authentication status.

// - **Logging and Analytics:** Capturing data or events for analytics purposes without cluttering the presentation components.

// - **State Management:** Sharing state or logic across multiple components.

// ### How to Use Higher-Order Components

// Here's a simple example of creating and using an HOC:

import React, { Component } from "react";

// Higher-Order Component (HOC)
const withLogger = (WrappedComponent) => {
  return class extends Component {
    componentDidMount() {
      console.log(`Component ${WrappedComponent.name} is mounted.`);
    }

    componentWillUnmount() {
      console.log(`Component ${WrappedComponent.name} is unmounted.`);
    }

    render() {
      return <WrappedComponent {...this.props} />;
    }
  };
};

// Component to be enhanced by the HOC
class MyComponent extends Component {
  render() {
    return <div>Hello, I am the wrapped component.</div>;
  }
}

// Wrapping MyComponent with the withLogger HOC
const MyComponentWithLogger = withLogger(MyComponent);

// Using the enhanced component
const Appp = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <MyComponentWithLogger />
    </div>
  );
};

// export default Appp;

// In this example:

// 1. `withLogger` is a Higher-Order Component that logs when the wrapped component (`WrappedComponent`) is mounted and unmounted.

// 2. `MyComponent` is a simple component that will be enhanced with the logging functionality.

// 3. `MyComponentWithLogger` is the result of wrapping `MyComponent` with the `withLogger` HOC.

// 4. In the `App` component, `MyComponentWithLogger` is used, and when it renders, you'll see log messages indicating when the component is mounted and unmounted.

// This is a basic example, but HOCs can be used for more complex scenarios and can be composed to create a chain of enhanced components. Keep in mind that with the introduction of React Hooks, some use cases for HOCs can be addressed using custom hooks and the `useEffect` hook. However, HOCs remain a valuable pattern in certain situations, especially for class components or when dealing with third-party libraries that are not hook-based.

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------

// Life cycle method in react
// ===========================

// In React, class components have a lifecycle that consists of various methods that are called at different stages of a component's existence. These lifecycle methods allow developers to perform actions or side effects at specific points in a component's life. With the introduction of React Hooks in functional components, some of these lifecycle methods have equivalents in the form of useEffect and other hooks. Here is an overview of the key lifecycle methods in class components:

// ### Mounting Lifecycle Methods:

// 1. **`constructor()`**
//    - Called when the component is initialized.
//    - Used for setting up initial state and binding event handlers.

// 2. **`static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state)`**
//    - Invoked right before rendering when new props or state are received.
//    - Used to update state based on changes in props.

// 3. **`render()`**
//    - Responsible for returning the component's UI.
//    - Should be a pure function without side effects.

// 4. **`componentDidMount()`**
//    - Called after the component has been rendered to the DOM.
//    - Used for initialization tasks, data fetching, or setting up subscriptions.

// ### Updating Lifecycle Methods:

// 5. **`static getDerivedStateFromProps(nextProps, nextState)`**
//    - Similar to the mounting phase, but invoked before every render during the updating phase.

// 6. **`shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState)`**
//    - Allows you to control whether the component should re-render.
//    - Used for optimization by preventing unnecessary renders.

// 7. **`render()`**
//    - Same as in the mounting phase, responsible for returning the updated UI.

// 8. **`getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState)`**
//    - Called right before changes are committed to the DOM.
//    - Used for capturing information from the DOM (e.g., scroll position) before it potentially changes.

// 9. **`componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot)`**
//    - Called after the component has been updated in the DOM.
//    - Used for side effects like network requests, updates based on prop/state changes, etc.

// ### Unmounting Lifecycle Method:

// 10. **`componentWillUnmount()`**
//     - Called before the component is removed from the DOM.
//     - Used for cleanup tasks, such as cancelling network requests or clearing up subscriptions.

// ### Error Handling Lifecycle Methods:

// 11. **`static getDerivedStateFromError(error)`**
//     - Used to update state in response to an error thrown by a descendant component.

// 12. **`componentDidCatch(error, info)`**
//     - Used for side effects or logging after an error has been caught.

// It's important to note that with the introduction of React Hooks, functional components have gained lifecycle-like features through the `useEffect` hook. Hooks like `useEffect` can cover scenarios that were previously handled by class component lifecycle methods. Always refer to the official React documentation for the most up-to-date information on lifecycle methods and hooks.

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// What is redux, expain? and how we use redux in react give example
// ===============================================================

// Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications, commonly used with React for managing the state of larger and more complex applications. It provides a centralized store to manage the state of the application in a predictable way, making it easier to debug, test, and reason about the application's behavior.

// ### Key Concepts in Redux:

// 1. **Store:** The single source of truth that holds the entire state tree of the application. It is read-only, and the only way to change the state is by dispatching actions.

// 2. **Actions:** Plain JavaScript objects that describe changes in the application state. They are dispatched to the store to initiate state updates.

// 3. **Reducers:** Functions that specify how the application's state changes in response to an action. They take the current state and an action as arguments and return the new state.

// 4. **Dispatch:** A method provided by the Redux store to trigger state changes. It takes an action as an argument.

// 5. **Selectors:** Functions that extract specific pieces of data from the state.

// ### How to Use Redux in a React Application:

// Here's a basic example of using Redux in a React application. We'll create a simple counter application:

// #### Step 1: Install Redux and React-Redux

// npm install redux react-redux

// #### Step 2: Set Up the Redux Store

// store.js
import { createStore } from "redux";

// Reducer function
const counterReducer = (state = { count: 0 }, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "INCREMENT":
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case "DECREMENT":
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

// Create the Redux store
const store = createStore(counterReducer);

// export default store;

// #### Step 3: Create React Components

// Counter.js
import React from "react";
import { useDispatch, useSelector } from "react-redux";

const Counter = () => {
  const count = useSelector((state) => state.count);
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "INCREMENT" })}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "DECREMENT" })}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
};

// export default Counter;

// #### Step 4: Integrate Redux in the App

// App.js
import React from "react";
import { Provider } from "react-redux";
import store from "./store";
import Counter from "./Counter";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Provider store={store}>
      <div>
        <h1>Redux Counter App</h1>
        <Counter />
      </div>
    </Provider>
  );
};

// export default App;

// In this example:

// - We define a Redux store using `createStore` and a reducer function (`counterReducer`) that handles state updates based on dispatched actions.

// - The `Counter` component uses `useSelector` to extract the count from the Redux store and `useDispatch` to dispatch actions to update the state.

// - The `Provider` component from `react-redux` is used to wrap the entire application, making the Redux store available to all components.

// - When the "Increment" or "Decrement" buttons are clicked, actions are dispatched to the store, and the `counterReducer` updates the state accordingly.

// This is a simple example, but Redux becomes especially powerful in more complex applications where multiple components need to share and manage state in a predictable way. It promotes a unidirectional data flow and makes state management more scalable and maintainable.

// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// custom Hooks
// ===============

// Custom hooks are a way to reuse stateful logic across different components in React. They allow you to extract and share common logic among functional components, promoting code reusability and maintainability. Custom hooks are regular JavaScript functions that start with the word "use" and can use other hooks inside them.

// useCounter.js
import { useState } from "react";

const useCounter = (initialValue = 0, step = 1) => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(initialValue);

  const increment = () => {
    setCount(count + step);
  };

  const decrement = () => {
    setCount(count - step);
  };

  return { count, increment, decrement };
};

// export default useCounter;

// In this example:
// - The custom hook `useCounter` takes two optional parameters (`initialValue` and `step`).
// - Inside the hook, it uses the `useState` hook to manage the state of a counter.
// - The hook returns an object with the current `count` value, as well as functions (`increment` and `decrement`) to update the counter.

// CounterComponent.js
import React from "react";
import useCounter from "./useCounter";

const CounterComponent = () => {
  // Using the custom hook
  const { count, increment, decrement } = useCounter(0, 2);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={decrement}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
};

// export default CounterComponent;

// In this component:
// - We import the `useCounter` custom hook and call it with initial values (0 and 2).
// - The `count`, `increment`, and `decrement` variables returned by the custom hook are used in the component.

// This separation of logic into a custom hook allows you to reuse the counter-related logic in multiple components without duplicating code. Custom hooks can be shared and used across different parts of your application, improving code organization and making it easier to manage complex logic.
// Remember, the name of a custom hook must start with "use" to signal to React that it should follow the rules of hooks.

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// explain lazy loading? with example
// ==================================

// Lazy loading is a technique in web development where resources (such as images, scripts, or components) are loaded asynchronously or on-demand, rather than being loaded all at once when the page initially loads. This can significantly improve the initial loading time and performance of a web application, especially for large or complex applications.

// In React, lazy loading is commonly used with the `React.lazy` function and the `Suspense` component to load components lazily. Lazy loading in React allows you to split your code into smaller chunks and load them only when needed.

// Here's an example of lazy loading components in a React application:

// Normal way of importing a component
// import MyComponent from './MyComponent';

import React, { lazy, Suspense } from "react";

// Using React.lazy to lazily import the component
const LazyLoadedComponent = lazy(() => import("./MyComponent"));

const LazyApp = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Lazy Loading Example</h1>

      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        {/* Render the lazily loaded component */}
        <LazyLoadedComponent />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
};

// export default LazyApp;

// In this example:
// - We use `React.lazy(() => import('./MyComponent'))` to lazily import the `MyComponent` module. The `import` function returns a Promise that resolves to the module containing the component.
// - We use the `Suspense` component to wrap the lazy-loaded component. The `fallback` prop specifies what to render while the component is being loaded.
// - When the `LazyLoadedComponent` is rendered, React will automatically load the necessary code chunk asynchronously, and once loaded, it will render the component.

// Lazy loading is especially useful for optimizing the loading time of large applications with multiple components. It helps reduce the initial bundle size and improves the user experience by loading only the required code when it's needed.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// CSR and SSR:
// ============

// **SSR (Server-Side Rendering):**

// Server-Side Rendering is a technique where the initial rendering of a React or any other JavaScript framework-based application is done on the server rather than in the browser. The server sends the fully-rendered HTML to the client, which can be displayed before any JavaScript is executed. This approach is beneficial for SEO, performance, and the user experience.

// Example of SSR in a React application:

// Express.js server handling SSR
const express = require("express");
const React = require("react");
const ReactDOMServer = require("react-dom/server");
const Apps = require("./App"); // Your React component

const app = express();

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  const html = ReactDOMServer.renderToString(<Apps />);
  res.send(`
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>SSR Example</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <div id="root">${html}</div>
      </body>
    </html>
  `);
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server is running on port 3000");
});

// **CSR (Client-Side Rendering):**

// Client-Side Rendering is the traditional way of rendering a React application. The HTML is initially minimal, containing a root element (usually a `<div>` with an id like "root"), and the JavaScript bundle is loaded asynchronously. The browser executes the JavaScript, which then renders the complete UI on the client side. CSR provides a smoother user experience after the initial load but may suffer from slower initial rendering and SEO challenges.

// Example of CSR in a React application:

// React component rendering on the client side
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import App from "./App"; // Your React component

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));

// **Difference between SSR and CSR:**

// 1. **Initial Load:**
//    - **SSR:** Delivers fully-rendered HTML from the server, which can be displayed before any JavaScript is executed.
//    - **CSR:** Delivers minimal HTML and loads JavaScript asynchronously. The initial rendering is done on the client side.

// 2. **Performance:**
//    - **SSR:** Generally provides faster time-to-content and perceived performance for the initial load.
//    - **CSR:** May have a slower initial load time but offers a smoother user experience after the initial load.

// 3. **SEO (Search Engine Optimization):**
//    - **SSR:** Better for SEO since search engines can crawl and index the fully-rendered HTML on the server.
//    - **CSR:** Requires additional efforts like server-side rendering of critical content for better SEO.

// 4. **Complexity:**
//    - **SSR:** Might involve more server-side configuration and potentially increased server load.
//    - **CSR:** Typically simpler to set up, especially for smaller applications, but may require additional tooling for optimal performance.

// 5. **User Experience:**
//    - **SSR:** Provides a faster perceived loading time and is better suited for users with slower network connections.
//    - **CSR:** Offers a smoother user experience after the initial load and is well-suited for applications with a high level of interactivity.

// Choosing between SSR and CSR depends on factors like the nature of your application, performance requirements, SEO considerations, and the target audience. Some applications might use a hybrid approach (e.g., Next.js in React) to combine the benefits of both SSR and CSR.

// Explain system design in details with example? also explain low level and high level system design with exapmle.
// ==================================================

// **System Design:**

// System design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. It is intended to be a blueprint for the construction of the system. The goal is to create a solution that can be effectively implemented and meets the requirements of the stakeholders.

// ### Components of System Design:

// 1. **Architectural Design:**
//    - Defines the overall structure of the system.
//    - Identifies major components and their relationships.

// 2. **High-Level Design:**
//    - Describes the system at a higher level of abstraction.
//    - Focuses on modules, functions, and their interactions.

// 3. **Low-Level Design:**
//    - Involves detailed specifications of individual components.
//    - Defines algorithms, data structures, and data flow within modules.

// ### Example: Online Shopping System

// **1. High-Level System Design:**

// - **Requirements:**
//   - Users can browse products, add them to the cart, and place orders.
//   - Users can register, log in, and manage their profiles.
//   - Admins can add, update, or remove products and manage user accounts.

// - **High-Level Architecture:**
//   - **Frontend:** React for the user interface.
//   - **Backend:** Node.js with Express for server-side logic.
//   - **Database:** MongoDB for storing product and user data.
//   - **Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication.

// **2. Low-Level System Design:**

// - **User Management Module:**
//   - **Functionality:** Register, log in, update profile.
//   - **Implementation:** Express routes for registration, login, and profile update.
//   - **Database:** User data stored in MongoDB, hashed passwords.

// - **Product Management Module:**
//   - **Functionality:** Add, update, remove products.
//   - **Implementation:** Express routes for CRUD operations on products.
//   - **Database:** Product data stored in MongoDB.

// - **Order Processing Module:**
//   - **Functionality:** Add products to the cart, place orders.
//   - **Implementation:** Express routes for cart management and order placement.
//   - **Database:** Cart and order data stored in MongoDB.

// ### Key Considerations:

// - **Scalability:** Design the system to handle an increasing number of users and transactions.
// - **Reliability:** Ensure the system is robust and can recover from failures.
// - **Security:** Implement authentication, authorization, and secure data storage.
// - **Performance:** Optimize the system for speed and efficiency.
// - **Maintainability:** Design code and architecture for easy maintenance and updates.

// This is a simplified example, and real-world system designs would involve more complexities, such as load balancing, caching strategies, and microservices architecture, depending on the scale and requirements of the application.

// ======================================

// **Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD)** are software development practices that enable teams to deliver code changes more frequently and reliably. CI/CD automates the process of integrating code changes into a shared repository, building and testing the application, and deploying it to production environments.

// ### Continuous Integration (CI):

// CI is the practice of frequently integrating code changes into a shared repository. With CI, developers merge their code changes to a central repository multiple times a day. Each integration triggers an automated build process, which includes compiling the code, running automated tests, and generating artifacts.

// **Key Steps in CI:**

// 1. **Version Control:** Developers commit their code changes to a version control system (e.g., Git).

// 2. **Automated Build:** A CI server automatically pulls the latest changes from the repository, compiles the code, and runs build scripts.

// 3. **Automated Testing:** Automated tests (unit tests, integration tests, etc.) are executed to verify the correctness of the code changes.

// 4. **Reporting:** CI servers provide feedback to developers about the build status and test results.

// ### Continuous Deployment (CD):

// CD is the practice of automatically deploying code changes to production or staging environments after successful CI. CD aims to automate the deployment process, reducing the time and effort required to release software updates.

// **Key Steps in CD:**

// 1. **Artifact Generation:** After a successful build, CI generates deployable artifacts (e.g., compiled binaries, Docker images).

// 2. **Deployment Automation:** CD pipelines automate the deployment process, including provisioning infrastructure, configuring environments, and deploying artifacts.

// 3. **Testing in Production:** Some CD pipelines include automated tests in production-like environments to validate the behavior of the application before releasing it to production.

// 4. **Monitoring and Rollback:** Continuous monitoring of deployed applications allows for detecting issues quickly. CD pipelines may include automated rollback mechanisms to revert to previous versions in case of failures.

// ### Example of CI/CD Pipeline:

// Let's consider a simple web application deployed on AWS:

// 1. **CI Pipeline:**
//    - Developers push code changes to a Git repository (e.g., GitHub).
//    - A Jenkins CI server monitors the repository for changes.
//    - Jenkins pulls the latest changes, builds the application using Maven, and runs unit tests.
//    - If the build and tests pass, Jenkins creates a deployable artifact (e.g., a JAR file).

// 2. **CD Pipeline:**
//    - A Jenkins CD pipeline is triggered by successful builds from the CI pipeline.
//    - The CD pipeline deploys the artifact to a staging environment on AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
//    - Automated integration tests are executed in the staging environment to validate the application's behavior.
//    - If tests pass in staging, the CD pipeline automatically deploys the artifact to the production environment.

// ### Benefits of CI/CD:

// 1. **Faster Time to Market:** CI/CD automates the build, test, and deployment process, allowing teams to release software updates more frequently and reliably.

// 2. **Reduced Risk:** Automated testing and deployment minimize human errors and improve the quality of released software.

// 3. **Increased Collaboration:** CI/CD encourages collaboration among developers by promoting frequent integration of code changes and providing immediate feedback on build and test results.

// 4. **Scalability and Reliability:** CI/CD pipelines can scale to handle complex deployment scenarios and provide consistent and repeatable deployment processes.

// 5. **Feedback Loop:** CI/CD provides rapid feedback to developers, allowing them to identify and fix issues early in the development cycle.

// Overall, CI/CD enables teams to deliver high-quality software faster and more efficiently, leading to improved customer satisfaction and competitive advantage.
