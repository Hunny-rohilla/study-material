// I. Introduction to MongoDB
// Definition: MongoDB is a NoSQL document-oriented database that provides a flexible and scalable data storage solution. It stores data in JSON-like documents, allowing for schema flexibility and efficient handling of data with varying structures.

// Here's a comprehensive explanation of the differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

// **************** 1. Data Model: ****************

// - **SQL:** Relational databases (RDBMS) employ a **structured** data model, organized in **tables** with predefined **schemas**. Each table has columns (fields) with specific data types, and relationships between tables are established through foreign keys. This structure ensures data consistency and integrity.
// - **NoSQL:** Non-relational databases follow **flexible** data models, allowing for **schema-less** or **dynamic schemas**. Data is typically stored in **documents**, **key-value pairs**, **graphs**, or **wide-column stores**. This flexibility caters to data with varying structures and evolving requirements.

// **************** 2. Query Language: ****************

// - **SQL:** Uses the **Structured Query Language (SQL)** for data manipulation. SQL is a standardized language with specific syntax for querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data in relational databases.
// - **NoSQL:** Each NoSQL database type typically has its **own query language** or interface for accessing and manipulating data. While some NoSQL databases offer query languages similar to SQL, others use different approaches like document querying or graph traversal.

// **************** 3. Scaling: ****************

// - **SQL:** Primarily **vertically** scalable. This means increasing the processing power, memory, or storage capacity of a single server to handle growing data volumes. Vertical scaling can become expensive as hardware resources reach their limits.
// - **NoSQL:** Often **horizontally** scalable. This involves distributing data across multiple servers (sharding) to handle increased load and data growth. This approach is generally more cost-effective and flexible for large datasets.

// **************** 4. Consistency: ****************

// - **SQL:** Guarantees **ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)** properties. This ensures data integrity and consistency across transactions, making SQL well-suited for critical applications requiring strong data reliability.
// - **NoSQL:** Often prioritizes **availability** and **scalability** over strict consistency. This may lead to eventual consistency, where data updates might not be immediately reflected across all servers, which might be acceptable for less critical applications emphasizing performance and scalability.

// ==============**Choosing the Right Database:**=====================

// The choice between SQL and NoSQL depends on various factors, including:

// - **Data structure:**
// If your data is highly structured and requires complex relationships, SQL is a good fit. For unstructured or semi-structured data, NoSQL might be more suitable.

// - **Querying needs:**
// For complex queries involving multiple tables and relationships, SQL excels. If your queries are simpler or focused on individual documents or elements, NoSQL might suffice.

// - **Scalability requirements:**
// If you anticipate significant data growth, NoSQL's horizontal scalability might be more efficient than SQL's vertical scaling.

// - **Performance requirements:**
// Both SQL and NoSQL can offer high performance, but the choice can depend on specific use cases and query patterns.

// It's crucial to carefully evaluate your project's requirements and consider the strengths and weaknesses of both SQL and NoSQL databases before making a decision.

// ******************** Key Concepts: **************************

// Documents: The fundamental unit of data storage in MongoDB. A document is a self-contained unit resembling a JSON object, with key-value pairs holding data.

// Collections: Groups of logically related documents. They are akin to tables in relational databases, but without a predefined schema.

// Databases: Collections are organized within databases, providing a way to categorize and manage large amounts of data.

// Indexes: Similar to indexes in relational databases, MongoDB indexes improve query performance by creating ordered listings of specific fields or combinations of fields.

// Schema Flexibility: MongoDB allows for documents within a collection to have different structures, unlike relational databases with a rigid schema.

// Relationships: While MongoDB doesn't enforce relationships like relational databases, it offers embedded documents and references (DBRef) to model relationships within documents or across collections.

// Replication: Enables data redundancy and high availability by maintaining copies of the database on multiple servers.

// Sharding: Horizontally scales data storage by distributing collections across multiple shards (partitions) on different servers, handling large datasets efficiently.

// ### MongoDB Overview:

// **MongoDB** is a popular NoSQL database that provides a flexible and scalable approach to storing and managing data. It uses a document-oriented model, where data is represented in flexible, JSON-like BSON (Binary JSON) documents. MongoDB is known for its high performance, scalability, and ease of use.

// ### Important Concepts:

// 1. **Document:**
// - **Theory:** A document in MongoDB is a set of key-value pairs, similar to JSON objects. It is the basic unit of data storage.

```
     {
       "_id": ObjectId("5f8b56e1bf956104b93b9999"),
       "name": "John Doe",
       "age": 30,
       "address": {
         "city": "New York",
         "zipcode": "10001"
       }
     }
```;

// 2. **Collection:**
// - **Theory:** A collection is a grouping of MongoDB documents. It is equivalent to an RDBMS table.
db.users.insertOne({
  name: "Alice",
  age: 25,
});

// 3. **Indexing:**
// - **Theory:** Indexes in MongoDB improve the efficiency of read operations. They provide a quick way to locate documents based on specific fields.

db.users.createIndex({ name: 1 });

// 4. **Querying:**
// - **Theory:** MongoDB supports rich query operations, including filtering, sorting, and projection, to retrieve specific documents from a collection.

db.users.find({ age: { $gt: 25 } });

// 5. **Aggregation:**
// - **Theory:** MongoDB's aggregation framework allows the processing of data records to produce aggregated results.

db.orders.aggregate([
  { $match: { status: "completed" } },
  { $group: { _id: "$product", total: { $sum: "$quantity" } } },
]);

// ### Interview Questions:

// #### Easy:
// 1. What is MongoDB?
// 2. How are documents represented in MongoDB?
// 3. Explain the concept of a collection.
// 4. What is indexing in MongoDB?
// Theory: Indexing in MongoDB is the process of creating an index on a specific field within a collection. Indexes improve the efficiency of query operations by providing a quick way to locate documents based on the indexed fields, similar to indexes in traditional relational databases.
// 5. How do you insert a document into a MongoDB collection?

// #### Medium:
// 6. **Discuss the differences between MongoDB and traditional relational databases.**
// - **Theory:**
//   - MongoDB is a NoSQL database, while traditional relational databases are SQL-based.
//   - MongoDB uses a flexible, schema-less document model, whereas relational databases use a fixed schema.
//   - MongoDB supports horizontal scaling through sharding, allowing for distributed data storage.
//   - Relational databases use structured query language (SQL) for querying, while MongoDB uses a JavaScript-based query language.

// 7. **Explain the purpose of indexing in MongoDB.**
// - **Theory:**
//   - Indexing in MongoDB improves the efficiency of read operations by providing a quick way to locate documents based on indexed fields.
//   - It speeds up the query process by reducing the number of documents that need to be scanned.
//   - Indexes can be created on single fields, compound fields, arrays, and subdocuments.

// 8. **How do you update documents in MongoDB?**
//      // Example: Updating a document in the "users" collection
db.users.updateOne(
  { name: "John Doe" },
  { $set: { age: 31, "address.city": "San Francisco" } }
);

//      The `updateOne` method is used to update a single document based on a specified filter. The `$set` operator updates the specified fields.

// 9. **What is the significance of the `_id` field in MongoDB documents?**
// - **Theory:**
//   - The `_id` field is a unique identifier for each document in a collection.
//   - MongoDB automatically creates an `_id` field if one is not provided during document insertion.
//   - The `_id` field is used as the primary key and ensures the uniqueness of each document.

// 10. **Describe the advantages and disadvantages of using MongoDB.**
// - **Advantages:**
//   - Schema flexibility: MongoDB allows dynamic and flexible schemas, accommodating changes in data structure.
//   - Horizontal scaling: MongoDB supports sharding for distributing data across multiple servers, enabling scalability.
//   - No SQL joins: Documents can store related data in nested structures, reducing the need for complex joins.

// - **Disadvantages:**
//   - Lack of ACID compliance: MongoDB sacrifices some aspects of ACID properties for flexibility and scalability.
//   - Learning curve: Developers accustomed to relational databases may find MongoDB's document-oriented model requires adaptation.
//   - Memory consumption: MongoDB may use more memory compared to traditional relational databases for certain workloads.

// #### Hard:
// 11. **Explain the MongoDB aggregation framework.**
// - **Theory:**
//     - MongoDB's aggregation framework is a powerful tool for processing and transforming data within the database.
//     - It allows users to perform operations like filtering, grouping, sorting, and projecting to obtain aggregated results.
//     - Aggregation pipelines consist of stages, where each stage performs a specific operation on the data.

// 12. **How does MongoDB handle transactions?**
// - **Theory:**
//     - MongoDB supports multi-document transactions for operations on multiple documents.
//     - Transactions ensure the atomicity of operations, meaning they either succeed entirely or have no effect.
//     - Transactions are initiated using the `startSession` method, and operations within the transaction are encapsulated in the `withTransaction` method.

// 13. **Discuss the role of sharding in MongoDB for horizontal scaling.**
// - **Theory:**
//     - Sharding in MongoDB involves partitioning a database across multiple servers to distribute data.
//     - Each shard is an independent database and collectively they form a sharded cluster.
//     - Sharding improves horizontal scalability by allowing the distribution of data and query load across multiple servers.

// 14. **What are the different types of indexing in MongoDB?**
// - **Theory:**
//     - Single Field Index: Index on a single field for fast retrieval based on that field.
//     - Compound Index: Index on multiple fields to support queries that involve multiple fields.
//     - Multikey Index: Index on an array field, indexing each element of the array.
//     - Text Index: Index for text search on string content.
//     - Geospatial Index: Index for queries involving geographical coordinates.

// 15. **Explain the concept of capped collections in MongoDB.**
// - **Theory:**
//     - Capped collections are fixed-size collections in MongoDB with a defined maximum number of documents.
//     - Once the collection reaches its maximum size, older documents are overwritten by new ones.
//     - Capped collections are useful for scenarios like log storage, where old data can be automatically purged.
